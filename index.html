                    <p>We founded Home Away From Home because of our co-founder Kate Blumenthal.<br>
                        Kate and Joe McKenzie were inspired from Kate's personal journey of battling an illness in the hospital.<br>
                        After enduring 70 days hospitalized in 2023, grappling with an NJ tube and multiple life-threatening bacterial infections, 
                        <br>Kate needed to give back once her healing process began. Joe and Kate were motivated to make a warmer, more comfortable environment. 
                        <br>This experience fueled our mission to create spaces within healthcare facilities that feel like home, 
                        <br>providing pure joy and support to patients during their toughest times.</p>
